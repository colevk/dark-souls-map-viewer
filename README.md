##Dark Souls Map Viewer

WebGL/three.js implementation of a map viewer for _Dark Souls_ and _Dark Souls
2_, using the games' collision data.

###Details

Inspired by Vlad001's
[dksmv](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7876&start=60), from which
I took the extracted map files for _Dark Souls_ (rehosted by Kayin Nasaki
[here](http://kayin.pyoko.org/?p=2218)). There is also the [Dark Souls Map
Explorer](http://kayin.pyoko.org/?p=2249), created by Kayin Nasaki. The map
files for _Dark Souls 2_ were extracted by
[Ispohr](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/21kxov/dark_souls_2_map_vie
 wer/). The .iv file format was deciphered by looking at Allanlw's
[eat.py](https://gist.github.com/allanlw/8214620). Wireframe rendering taken
from [Florian Boesch's
guide](http://codeflow.org/entries/2012/aug/02/easy-wireframe-display-with-baryc
 entric-coordinates/) and from [B&aelig;rentze et
al](http://webstaff.itn.liu.se/~andyn/courses/tncg08/sketches06/sketches/0505-ba
 erentzen.pdf).

The font used in the icons is Optimus Princeps Semi Bold.
